        "The eigenfunctions of a Schrodinger equation are important objects in physics and mathematics. The eigenfunction finding algorithms are knowning to be costy when the sample size is large. On the other hand, solving a Poisson equation with potential can be reduced to solve a linear equation which is easier than the eigenfunction problem. \n",
